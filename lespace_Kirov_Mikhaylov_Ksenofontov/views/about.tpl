  <p class="lead">On this page you will see a brief description and photos of the planets of our solar system.

  This is the closest planet to the Sun, so the Sun shines on Mercury and warms 7 times more than on Earth.
  On the day side of Mercury, it is terribly hot, there is an eternal inferno. Measurements show that the temperature there rises to 400 degrees above zero.
  But on the night side there should always be a strong frost, which probably reaches 200 degrees below zero.
  So, Mercury is the kingdom of deserts. One half of it is a hot stone desert, the other half is an icy desert, perhaps covered with frozen gases.
  The composition of the extremely rarefied atmosphere of Mercury includes: Ar, Ne, He.
  The surface of Mercury is similar in appearance to that of the moon. When Mercury is far enough away from the Sun , it can be seen, it stands low above the horizon.
  Mercury is never visible in a dark sky. It is best to observe it in the evening sky or before dawn. Mercury has no moons.
  80% of the mass of Mercury is contained in its core consisting mainly of iron.
  The pressure at the surface of the planet is about 500 billion. times less than the surface of the Earth.
  It also turned out that Mercury has a weak magnetic field, the intensity of which is only 0.7% of the earth's.
  Mercury belongs to the terrestrial planets. In Roman mythology , the god of commerce.</p>

  The second planet from the Sun, has an almost circular orbit. 
  It passes closer to Earth than any other planet. 
  But the dense, cloudy atmosphere does not allow you to directly see its surface. 
  Atmosphere: CO2 (97%), N2 (approx. 3%), H2O (0.05%), impurities of CO, SO2, HCl, HF. 
  Due to the greenhouse effect, the surface temperature warms up to hundreds of degrees. 
  The atmosphere, which is a dense blanket of carbon dioxide, retains the heat that has come from the Sun. 
  This leads to the fact that the temperature of the atmosphere is much higher than in the oven. 
  The radar images show a very wide variety of craters, volcanoes, and mountains. 
  There are several very large volcanoes, up to 3 km high. and hundreds of kilometers wide. 
  The outpouring of lava on Venus takes much longer than on Earth. The surface pressure is about 107 Pa. 
  The surface rocks of Venus are similar in composition to Terrestrial sedimentary rocks.</p>

  The third planet from the Sun. The speed of the Earth's rotation in an elliptical orbit around the Sun is 29.765 km/s.
  The inclination of the earth's axis to the plane of the ecliptic is 66o33 '22". 
  The Earth has a natural satellite-the Moon. The Earth has magnetic and electric fields. 
  The earth was formed 4.7 billion years ago. years ago, from gas-dust matter scattered in the protosolar system. 
  The Earth's composition is dominated by iron (34.6%), oxygen (29.5%), silicon (15.2%), and magnesium (12.7%). 
  The pressure in the center of the planet is 3.6*1011Pa, the density is about 12,500 kg / m3, the temperature is 5000-6000 oC. 
  Most of the surface is occupied by the World Ocean (361.1 million km2; 70.8%); land is 149.1 million km2 and forms six continents and islands. 
  It rises above the world ocean level by an average of 875 meters (the highest height is 8848 meters - the city of Jomolungma). 
  Mountains cover 30% of the land, deserts cover about 20% of the land surface, savannas and woodlands-about 20%, forests-about 30%, glaciers-10%. 
  The average depth of the ocean is about 3800 meters, the largest is 11022 meters (the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean), the volume of water is 1370 million km3, the average salinity is 35 g/l. 
  The Earth's atmosphere, with a total mass of 5.15*1015 tons, consists of air - a mixture mainly of nitrogen (78.1%) and oxygen (21%), the rest - water vapor, carbon dioxide, noble and other gases.</p>
