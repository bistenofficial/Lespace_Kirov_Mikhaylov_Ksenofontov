  "This is the closest planet to the Sun, so the Sun shines on Mercury and warms 7 times more than on Earth.
  On the day side of Mercury, it is terribly hot, there is an eternal inferno. Measurements show that the temperature there rises to 400 degrees above zero.
  But on the night side there should always be a strong frost, which probably reaches 200 degrees below zero.
  So, Mercury is the kingdom of deserts. One half of it is a hot stone desert, the other half is an icy desert, perhaps covered with frozen gases.
  The composition of the extremely rarefied atmosphere of Mercury includes: Ar, Ne, He.
  The surface of Mercury is similar in appearance to that of the moon. When Mercury is far enough away from the Sun , it can be seen, it stands low above the horizon.
  Mercury is never visible in a dark sky. It is best to observe it in the evening sky or before dawn. Mercury has no moons.
  80% of the mass of Mercury is contained in its core consisting mainly of iron.
  The pressure at the surface of the planet is about 500 billion. times less than the surface of the Earth.
  It also turned out that Mercury has a weak magnetic field, the intensity of which is only 0.7% of the earth's.
  Mercury belongs to the terrestrial planets. In Roman mythology , the god of commerce."
