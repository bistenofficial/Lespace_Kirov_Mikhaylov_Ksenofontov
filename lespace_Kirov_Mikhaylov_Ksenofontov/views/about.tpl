  Mercury
  <br>
  This is the closest planet to the Sun, so the Sun shines on Mercury and warms 7 times more than on Earth.
  On the day side of Mercury, it is terribly hot, there is an eternal inferno. Measurements show that the temperature there rises to 400 degrees above zero.
  But on the night side there should always be a strong frost, which probably reaches 200 degrees below zero.
  So, Mercury is the kingdom of deserts. One half of it is a hot stone desert, the other half is an icy desert, perhaps covered with frozen gases.
  The composition of the extremely rarefied atmosphere of Mercury includes: Ar, Ne, He.
  The surface of Mercury is similar in appearance to that of the moon. When Mercury is far enough away from the Sun , it can be seen, it stands low above the horizon.
  Mercury is never visible in a dark sky. It is best to observe it in the evening sky or before dawn. Mercury has no moons.
  80% of the mass of Mercury is contained in its core consisting mainly of iron.
  The pressure at the surface of the planet is about 500 billion. times less than the surface of the Earth.
  It also turned out that Mercury has a weak magnetic field, the intensity of which is only 0.7% of the earth's.
  Mercury belongs to the terrestrial planets. In Roman mythology , the god of commerce.</p>

  Venus
  <br>
  The second planet from the Sun, has an almost circular orbit. 
  It passes closer to Earth than any other planet. 
  But the dense, cloudy atmosphere does not allow you to directly see its surface. 
  Atmosphere: CO2 (97%), N2 (approx. 3%), H2O (0.05%), impurities of CO, SO2, HCl, HF. 
  Due to the greenhouse effect, the surface temperature warms up to hundreds of degrees. 
  The atmosphere, which is a dense blanket of carbon dioxide, retains the heat that has come from the Sun. 
  This leads to the fact that the temperature of the atmosphere is much higher than in the oven. 
  The radar images show a very wide variety of craters, volcanoes, and mountains. 
  There are several very large volcanoes, up to 3 km high. and hundreds of kilometers wide. 
  The outpouring of lava on Venus takes much longer than on Earth. The surface pressure is about 107 Pa. 
  The surface rocks of Venus are similar in composition to Terrestrial sedimentary rocks.</p>

  Earth
  <br>
  The third planet from the Sun. The speed of the Earth's rotation in an elliptical orbit around the Sun is 29.765 km/s.
  The inclination of the earth's axis to the plane of the ecliptic is 66o33 '22". 
  The Earth has a natural satellite-the Moon. The Earth has magnetic and electric fields. 
  The earth was formed 4.7 billion years ago. years ago, from gas-dust matter scattered in the protosolar system. 
  The Earth's composition is dominated by iron (34.6%), oxygen (29.5%), silicon (15.2%), and magnesium (12.7%). 
  The pressure in the center of the planet is 3.6*1011Pa, the density is about 12,500 kg / m3, the temperature is 5000-6000 oC. 
  Most of the surface is occupied by the World Ocean (361.1 million km2; 70.8%); land is 149.1 million km2 and forms six continents and islands. 
  It rises above the world ocean level by an average of 875 meters (the highest height is 8848 meters - the city of Jomolungma). 
  Mountains cover 30% of the land, deserts cover about 20% of the land surface, savannas and woodlands-about 20%, forests-about 30%, glaciers-10%. 
  The average depth of the ocean is about 3800 meters, the largest is 11022 meters (the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean), the volume of water is 1370 million km3, the average salinity is 35 g/l. 
  The Earth's atmosphere, with a total mass of 5.15*1015 tons, consists of air - a mixture mainly of nitrogen (78.1%) and oxygen (21%), the rest - water vapor, carbon dioxide, noble and other gases.</p>

  Mars
  <br>
  The fourth planet from the Sun, similar to Earth, but smaller and colder. 
  Mars has deep canyons, giant volcanoes, and vast deserts. 
  Around the Red Planet, as Mars is also called, fly two small moons: Phobos and Deimos. 
  Mars is the next planet after Earth, if you count from the Sun. 
  Near the equator of Mars, in an area called Tharsis, there are volcanoes of colossal size. 
  Tharsis - the name that astronomers gave to the hill, which has 400 km. in width and about 10 km. in height. 
  On this plateau there are four volcanoes, each of which is simply a giant in comparison with any terrestrial volcano. 
  The most grandiose volcano of Tharsis, Mount Olympus, rises 27 km above the surrounding area. 
  About two-thirds of the surface of Mars is mountainous terrain with a large number of craters formed from impacts and surrounded by debris from hard rocks. 
  Near the volcanoes of Tharsis, a vast system of canyons snaking about a quarter of the equator long. 
  The Mariner Valley is 600 km wide and its depth is such that Mount Everest would sink entirely to its bottom.
  The sheer cliffs rise for thousands of meters, from the valley floor to the plateau above. In ancient times, there was a lot of water on Mars, and large rivers flowed on the surface of this planet. 
  There are ice caps at the South and North poles of Mars. But this ice does not consist of water, but of solidified atmospheric carbon dioxide (solidifies at a temperature of-100oC). 
  Scientists believe that surface water is stored in the form of ice blocks buried in the ground, especially in the polar regions. Atmospheric composition: CO2 (95%), N2 (2.5%), Ar (1.5 - 2%), CO (0.06%), H2O (up to 0.1%); surface pressure 5-7 hPa.

   Jupiter
   <br>
   The fifth planet from the Sun, the largest planet in the Solar System. 
   Jupiter is not a solid planet. Unlike the four solid planets closest to the Sun, Jupiter is a ball of gas.
   Atmospheric composition: H2(85%), CH4, NH3, He (14%). 
   The gas composition of Jupiter is very similar to that of the sun.
   Jupiter is a powerful source of thermal radio radiation. 
   Jupiter has 16 moons (Adrasteia, Metis, Amalthea, Thebes, Io, Lysithea, Elara, Ananke, Carme, Pasife, Sinope, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Leda, Himalia), 
   as well as a ring with a width of 20,000 km, almost closely adjacent to the planet. 
   The speed of Jupiter's rotation is so great that the planet bulges out along the equator. 
   In addition, this rapid rotation is the cause of very strong winds in the upper atmosphere, where the clouds are drawn out in long colorful ribbons. 
   There are a very large number of vortex spots in the clouds of Jupiter. The largest of them - the so-called Great Red Spot, exceeds the size of the Earth.
   The Great Red Spot is a huge storm in the atmosphere of Jupiter, which has been observed for 300 years. 
   Inside the planet, under enormous pressure, hydrogen turns from gas to liquid, and then from liquid to solid.
   At a depth of 100 km, there is a vast ocean of liquid hydrogen. Below 17,000 km. the hydrogen is compressed so much that its atoms are destroyed. 
   And then it begins to behave like metal; in this state, it easily conducts electricity.

   Saturn
   <br>
   The sixth planet from the Sun, it has an amazing ring system. 
   Due to the rapid rotation around its axis, Saturn is flattened at the poles. 
   The wind speed at the equator reaches 1800 km/h.
   The width of Saturn's rings is 400,000 km, but they are only a few tens of meters thick.
   The inner parts of the rings rotate around Saturn faster than the outer parts. 
   The rings are mostly made up of billions of small particles, each orbiting Saturn as a separate microscopic satellite.
   Probably, these "microsatellites" consist of water ice or of rocks covered with ice. 
   Their size ranges from a few centimeters to tens of meters. 
   In the rings there are also larger objects - stone blocks and fragments up to hundreds of meters across. 
   The gaps between the rings are caused by the gravitational forces of the seventeen moons (Hyperion, Mimas, Tethys, Titan, Enceladus, etc.), which cause the rings to split. 
   The composition of the atmosphere includes: CH4, H2, He, NH3.

   Uranus
   <br>
   The seventh planet from the Sun. 
   It was discovered in 1781 by the English astronomer William Herschel, and named after the Greek sky god Uranus. 
   The orientation of Uranus in space is different from the other planets of the Solar System - its axis of rotation lies "on its side" relative to the plane of rotation of this planet around the Sun.
   The axis of rotation is tilted at an angle of 98o.
   As a result, the planet is turned to the Sun alternately by the north pole, then by the south, then by the equator, then by the middle latitudes.
   Uranus has more than 27 moons (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, Cordelia, Ophelia, Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Portia, Rosalind, Belinda, Peck, etc.) and a ring system. 
   In the center of Uranus is a core consisting of stone and iron. 
   The composition of the atmosphere includes: H2, He, CH4 (14%).
